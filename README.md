# CE514Project-3
Spark Open Source Thermostat
============================

This repo contains all of the software goodies produced in a 18-hour Spark Team Hackaton described in detail on the [Spark Blog](http://blog.spark.io/2014/01/17/open-source-thermostat).



## Hardware


The thermostat display is composed of 3
[Adafruit Mini 8x8 LED Matrix boards](http://www.adafruit.com/products/870#Technical_Details).


Temperature and humidity sensor BME280 - Only four legs will be connected: VCC  (3V3), GND (GND), SCL (D1), SDA (D0). The latter two legs are for data exchange. it uses I2C protocol to store data of temperature and humidity.  We can find it needs a power supply (3.3 VDC), which can be provided by photon. And SCL and SDA should connect to the D1 and D0 in the photon.A reference to the temperature sensor: https://github.com/finitespace/BME280

These are all controlled by the Spark Core using a
common I2C bus where pin D0 is SDA and pin D1 is SCL.
The displays (from left to right) are on I2C addresses
0x70, 0x71, and 0x72.

### Schematic

The details of the circuit design and implementation can be viewed via EAGLE (a free program for PCB design, [downloadable here](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/)).
The eagle file is in the [hardware/EAGLE folder](hardware/EAGLE).

### Physical Design

3D model [sketch-up](http://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-make) files are available in [hardware/folder](hardware/CAD).
If you're viewing this on GitHub (and using a modern browser), you can [view a 3D rendering](hardware/CAD/thermostat.stl) of it too.

## Firmware

To build firmware for this product, you'll first need to be able to build Spark Core firmware by following the instructions
[shown here](https://github.com/spark/core-firmware).

Once you have that working, you can simply copy all of the files from `/firmware` in this repo into `core-firmware/src` and run `make` again to build.  (i.e. `cp thermostat/firmware/* core-firmware/src`)

Alternatively, you could use the [Spark Web IDE](https://www.spark.io).

## Server Setup

The server components are:
* a Rails 3.2 app
* Sidekiq and Redis for background job processing

Development was done on OS X.

### Dependencies

* Ruby 2.0 (recommended to use rvm, rbenv, chruby, or other ruby version manager) (this app is ruby-2.0.0-p247)
* bundler: `gem install bundler`
* Install redis: `brew install redis`
* Install foreman: download package from here https://github.com/ddollar/foreman
* `bundle install`

### Run Locally

In one terminal:

    redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

(following instructions from homebrew install)

In another terminal:

    bash script/start_server.sh

* Note: You might need to change the SPARK_CORE_DEVICE_ID and SPARK_CORE_ACCESS_TOKEN env vars in this .sh file
  for this to work.

Hit `http://localhost:5000` in a browser

### Dev tips

You can put `binding.pry` pretty much anywhere in the code to bring up an interative debuging console.
Then hit a brower make or whatever, and in the terminal where the start_server.sh script ran, you can type commands (like a var name) and see their value, etc.

The "SQLite Professional Read-Only" OS X app is a nice free app to look at the data the app is generating in real time.

When developing, it's nice to be able to destroy everything and start fresh when you are hacking:

    bash script/bomb_and_rebuild.sh

### What's Next?

Get your hack on, :), have fun. If you do something cool with anything in here, consider sharing it on the [community site](http://community.sparkdevices.com).

If you want to list your cool open thermostat project here, issue a pull request.

If your are interested in continuing the effort to build an easy-to-build-and-install Spark powered open-source thermostat, please contact joe@spark.io or create a GitHub issue.
Though we'd love to do this ourselves, we don't currently have the bandwidth here at Spark. Hope to hear from you.
