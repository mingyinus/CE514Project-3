## Hardware


The thermostat display is composed of 3
[Adafruit Mini 8x8 LED Matrix boards](http://www.adafruit.com/products/870#Technical_Details).


Temperature and humidity sensor BME280 - Only four legs will be connected: VCC  (3V3), GND (GND), SCL (D1), SDA (D0). The latter two legs are for data exchange. it uses I2C protocol to store data of temperature and humidity.  We can find it needs a power supply (3.3 VDC), which can be provided by photon. And SCL and SDA should connect to the D1 and D0 in the photon.A reference to the temperature sensor: https://github.com/finitespace/BME280

These are all controlled by the Spark Core using a
common I2C bus where pin D0 is SDA and pin D1 is SCL.
The displays (from left to right) are on I2C addresses
0x70, 0x71, and 0x72.
